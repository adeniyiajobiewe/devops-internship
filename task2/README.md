# CI/CD

## 1. Create a CI pipeline

1. Create a pipeline that builds the application, runs the tests, and pushes the image to Docker Hub.
   1. You can use any CI/CD tool you prefer, e.g. GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.
   2. The pipeline doesn't need to be fully functional; feel free to add placeholder steps.
   3. Save the pipeline definition in the folder `task2/ci`.
