# IaC/Terraform

> **_NOTE:_**  We understand that setting up an account on a cloud provider can be a bit of a hassle, so we will accept Terraform code that describes the resources even if it doesn't actually create them.

1. Using [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs), create an instance/VM on a cloud provider of your choice. Most cloud providers have a free tier, so you can use that.
   1. You can use any cloud provider you prefer, i.e. AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean, etc.
   2. The instance should run Ubuntu 20.04.
   3. Save the instance definition in the folder `task4/terraform`.
